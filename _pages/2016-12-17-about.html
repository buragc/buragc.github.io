<p>I live and work in New York. I love architecting, designing and creating software products. I have worked with start-ups and Fortune companies to create new technology products &amp; services including web applications, mobile applications, APIs and big data solutions. </p>
<p>I very much enjoy helping non-profits by making their lives easier with software. </p>
<p>I  am a big soccer fan and a foodie. Warm weather and second cup of coffee is when I am at my best.</p>
