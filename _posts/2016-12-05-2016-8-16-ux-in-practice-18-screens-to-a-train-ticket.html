<h3>UX in Italy: 18 screens to buy a train ticket</h3>
<p>I was in Cinque Terre region in north eastern Italy for a week last month. It is a <a target="_blank" href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/826">UNESCO Heritage Site</a> and I definitely recommend it, especially if you like hiking.</p>
<p>Part of our plan was to take trains to neighboring towns and do one-way hikes. Every time we approached the train station to buy our tickets, we ended up seeing a long line of tourists and locals queued up, waiting in 95F degree weather frustrated.</p>
<p>Each ticket sale through the kiosk took an average of 2.5 minutes from start to finish. To understand why, take a look at the screens I had to navigate through to get two tickets (with no mistakes, or navigating back)</p>
<p>For a country that leads the way in design, I was really disappointed to see this user experience. I am hoping that it will be improved for my next visit next year.</p>
<p>Here are the screens of the kiosk machine:</p>
<p>Step 1. Choose your language</p>

<p>Step 2. Just a warning</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d44af46a49635bed4aa275_1473530623222__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 3. What do you want to do?</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d44b20e3df286e27f09428_1473530661773__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 4. Where are you going to? There are no options here but you can tap to type the station name.</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d44b50bebafba39be18900_1473530709328__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p>Step 5. Ok, let's type the station name. Notice the redundant "Arrival"</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d44b8444024343d192b0bb_1473530762154__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p>Step 6. When? Wouldn't it make sense to list the next few trains on the top of this screen to cover at least 80% of the use cases with one tap rather than selecting a date AND a time slot?</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d44bb2b8a79baee744d057_1473530807973__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 7. Wait for it</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d44bed414fb51a88adf186_1473530872854__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 8. Here are a few trains or you can choose to see "all the solutions". There is no explanation of what "2nd class" actually means. </p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d44c135016e199d1d68c5a_1473530905243__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 9. Just checking we are still cool</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d44c63d1758ebde02bce17_1473530999573__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 10. You actually cannot get an assigned seat, but this screen just pop-up with 0 alternative flows. </p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d44c9dd482e9b1b35ab27d_1473531051804__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 11. One of the few screens that actually make sense.</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d44ce8f5e231385728ded4_1473531116074__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 12. Just checking you are ready to purchase it! I understand the corporate code/business use case, wouldn't it be easier to get that out of the way in the beginning by understanding the intent?</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d44d0fe3df286e27f0a59e_1473531163939__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 13. A warning</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d46a779de4bbc2c544d7c1_1473538684433__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 14. How do you want to pay?</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d46a93725e2540621df962_1473538713939__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 15. Put your card in</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d46aac725e2540621dfa5a_1473538735588__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 16. Let us process</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d46ac9725e2540621dfb94_1473538766421__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 17. Take your card out!</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d46ae03e00be430c51138d_1473538791337__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Step 18. Finally take your ticket and go :)</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_567717000e4c117c4c6423f8_56950c1c5a5668523b807d66_57d46afa9de4bbc2c544dc25_1473538815365__img.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p> </p>
<p>Hopefully someone will do something about this sooner than later but if you are planning on a trip to the region and want to take the train factor in an extra 15 minutes or so, since the lines form and grow very quickly.</p>
