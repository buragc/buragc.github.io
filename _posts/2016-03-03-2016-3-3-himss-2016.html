<p>I was at HIMSS with EPAM for the past few days. It’s been fun and exhausting at the same time. Here are some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Population health has turned into a buzzword. Everybody talks about it but very few companies can actually describe how they will move the needle.</li>
<li>Big Data is yet another buzzword. Without clear definition, everybody is claiming they do big data.</li>
<li>Collaboration tools; from data aggregation to secure messaging across providers have matured quite a bit. This opens up the opportunity to generate real insights from existing data using analytics and share them with providers and patients to make the largest impact.</li>
<li>One area I was disappointed in is the number of digital engagement platforms for patients. They were grossly underrepresented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is my prediction for 2016 in Health Tech; Companies that sit on vast data sets will start partnering/acquiring start-ups that can make sense out of the data in specific niches and we will see quite a bit of consolidation.</p>
<p>Exciting times in health technology!</p>
